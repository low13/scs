# SCS: System Command Shell

SCS is an open-source shell made with the Rust programming language

This repository contains all required files to compile a working copy of the program

WARNING: The program was designed to run on Windows and may not work in different systems

## INSTALLATION
You can download all necessary files in a release if avaliable

To compile the program yourself, you'll need to have Cargo installed which you can get [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), run one of the build scripts (build.bat for batch, build.ps1 for powershell and build.sh for shellscript) and you'll get a working copy of the program in the 'out' folder

If anything fails, you can contribute by opening an issue in GitHub
